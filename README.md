# NoteApp

## Description
This is a notes app written in `python` with `tkinter` module.  
It works in **window user-friendly interactive mode** and can be launched on Windows and Linux and presumably MacOS as well.
The data for the notes is stored in a **json** file. It will be created if it doesn't exist.

## Functionality
The NoteApp allows you to:
- Create notes, title them
- Save and store the notes
- Edit, rename and delete the notes
- Look at the list of all notes available, the list is updated automatically
- Sort the notes by id, name, date of creation or last change

## Requirements
Make sure you have **Python** and **tkinter module** installed.  
Tkinter comes pre-installed with the Python installer binaries for `Mac OS X` and the `Windows` platform.  
For Ubuntu users, the module can be installed with: `sudo apt-get install python3-tk`  

## Launch
Get the repository and launch `main.py` by whatever means you prefer.
